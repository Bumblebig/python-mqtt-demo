# Python MQTT Client with Paho Library

This is a sample Python MQTT client demonstrating how to use the Paho library to communicate with an MQTT broker. In this example, we'll be using HiveMQ as the MQTT broker.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Paho MQTT library installed. You can install it via pip:


`pip3 install paho-mqtt<2.0.0`

or for Python 3

`pip3 install paho-mqtt`

I recommned using the paho versions less than 2.0.0 if any errors arise
